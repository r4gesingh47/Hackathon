      <h1>About Us </h1>
      <h2>The heart of Health plus is questions</h2>
      <p>Questions that affect the world, questions that guide important life decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Health Plus exists</h2>
      <p> Our mission is to share knowledge and experiences about health.
            Not all knowledge can be written down, but much of that which can be, still isn't. 
            It remains in people’s heads or only accessible if you know the right people.
            We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, 
            to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better,
            and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.
      </p>
